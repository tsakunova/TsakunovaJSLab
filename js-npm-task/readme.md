Task: Implement app that contains at least one dependency and one dev dependency


I use [**i18next-translate everywhere**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/i18next) dependency and other dev dependency(webpack, sass-loader)


To install, you can use [npm](https://npmjs.org/)

    $ npm install

To build project, you can use:

    $ npm run build

To start dev-server, you can use:

    $ npm run server

The project builds into folder **dist**
